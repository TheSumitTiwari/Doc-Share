Hi All, esteemed leaders, and cherished colleagues,

It is both an honour and a privilege to stand before you today, reflecting on a remarkable year within this extraordinary organisation. Allow me to share a little something about my journey form the academic life to the colourful cubicles of corporate life, in college my main concerns was choosing between a black pen or blue pen for note taking and now I am grappling with the existential crisis of deciding whether to “reply all” or only “reply” in those never ending email threads. The acronyms here are like secret codes and I have definitely learned to nod and smile, mastering the art of looking confident even when I have absolutely no idea whats going on.

My journey began with a sense of anticipation, but little did I know that the experiences awaiting me would not only shape my professional growth but also instil a deep appreciation for the company values, culture, and an unwavering commitment to security.

Just after joining our organisation, I found myself immersed in a wealth of training opportunities that were both enlightening and empowering. The company's commitment to providing comprehensive training on security protocols and best practices was evident, equipping me with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the evolving landscape of cyber threats. One standout experience was the hackathon organised by the company—a dynamic forum where we were not only encouraged to explore our creativity but were also provided with a hands-on understanding of security risks. 

And just after the hackathon I stumbled upon a mail with subject “risk bulletin”which gets shared every quarter and it contains information about SIAI identified and experiences shared by all the issue identifier for that particular quarter, at that time I did not know about the word “SIAI”, which made me very curious and to reach out to my manager and my teammates to know more. They really helped me to understand about it and also how its an integral part of our organisations risk culture as “Identify”, “Escalate” and “Debate” and motivated me to question all the process and applications from the risk point of view to identify any gap. 

It was in the aftermath of the hackathon and all the learnings which I got from the team, that I identified a potential risk within my application. The risk was about “weak configuration of backend APIs which let unauthorised people to access it and about storing sensitive user auth data in logs”. What followed were steps that showcased the unwavering support of my managers, team, and leadership. They not only listened attentively to the concerns I raised but provided guidance and resources to ensure that the identified risk was appropriately logged and addressed and this whole process was a great learning opportunity which also helped me understand how as a organisation we mitigate risk and how “Identify”, “Escalate” and “Debate” really works. 

In closing,I am really thank full for the unwavering support, the invaluable lessons, and the privilege of being a part of this exceptional GFRR team.
